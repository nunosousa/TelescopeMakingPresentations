\frametitle{What is Amateur Telescope Making?}
\begin{block}{}
Amateur Telescope Making, or ATM, is a hobby taken by people that have an interest in astronomic observation and enjoy building telescopes.\footnotemark
\end{block}
\footnotetext{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_telescope_making}}
\begin{block}{}
ATM can range from just assembling the individually bought components to actually fabricate some or all of the components of a telescope.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
The most common type of telescope made by hobbyists is the so called Newtonian reflector (invented by Sir Isaac Newton).\footnotemark

\begin{columns}
\column{0.6\textwidth}
One time by chance a few years ago, I had the opportunity to look up at the night sky in Alentejo's countryside, in southern Portugal.

The combination of very low light pollution and clear sky provided for a very distinctive view of the Milky Way.

I had some interest in astronomy in general, but that event was what sparked the beggining of my interest in astronomical observation and ended up in deciding to build a telescope myself.

The main components of a Newtonian reflector telescope are the main mirror\footnotemark (right, blue),\footnotetext{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_mirror}}
the diagonal mirror (left, blue), and the eyepiece\footnotemark (opening at the top).
\footnotetext{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyepiece}}

Incoming light comes from the top of the telescope (left), iluminates the main mirror, and is reflected back to the eyepiece by the diagonal mirror.

\frametitle{My own telescope}
I'm building a Newtonian reflector telescope and I'm making the main mirror myself.

It has a 200mm diameter main mirror and a desired goal of a focal length of 1200mm.

Reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is the easiest type of telescope to make if one is also making the main optics.
\item For a certain cost, it gets you the biggest size optics.
\item A 200mm main mirror with 1200mm focal lenght is one of the most common configurations as a compromise between portability and light collection capability.
\end{itemize}
